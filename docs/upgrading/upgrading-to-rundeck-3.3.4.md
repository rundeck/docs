# Upgrading to Rundeck 3.3.4

## MySQL
:::warning
Starting with Rundeck `3.3.4` the MySQL JDBC driver will no longer
be bundled in any of the distributions(war, deb, rpm, Docker, etc). You must
take action for Rundeck to continue connecting to the database after upgrading.
:::

The MariaDB Connector/J JDBC driver will continue to be bundled with Rundeck,
and can be used as a replacement.

**For deb, rpm, and war**  
Set the following in `rundeck-config.properties`
```properties
dataSource.driverClassName=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
```

**For Docker**  
Set the following environment variable:
```bash
RUNDECK_DATABASE_DRIVER=dataSource.driverClassName
```
