# Rundeck 4.1 Upgrade Notes

:::warning
We have seen a few customers that are not using H2 as their database have an issue booting after the 4.1.0 upgrade.  The error will be the same error shown in the Database Upgrade section below. The solution is to remove the `{RUNDECK_HOME}/server/config/bootstrap.yml` file and restart Rundeck.  The file will be regenerated correctly on restart.
:::

## H2 Database Upgrade

In release 4.1.0 the lib version of the h2 database was updated to `2.1.210`.  The old version of the H2 database is not compatible with the newer library. Since the old library has a critical security vulnerability we have not included it in the release and there is no mechanism to migrate the 1.x database in the version automatically by Rundeck.  When attempting an in-place upgrade from a previous version to 4.1.0+ using H2 Rundeck startup will fail.

### H2 Migration Options

:::tip
Note: If you are using one of the **[supported production databases](/administration/install/index.html#database-configuration)** these migration steps can be ignored.
:::

**If you don't need to keep the data in your old H2 database:**

1. Remove the files from `{RUNDECK_HOME}/server/data`.
1. Restart Rundeck.  A new blank database will be created when Rundeck starts up.

:::warning
Note: This will wipe out all data in your Rundeck instance.  At a minimum we suggest backing up the files using the first steps below just in case you change your mind later.
:::

**If you need to keep the data in the old H2 database,** Rundeck has developed a script to help with migration.
### Preparation:

1. Create a backup directory `${backup_directory}` in your local file system to host the backup database files
1. Clone the git repo [h2-v2-migration](https://github.com/rundeck-plugins/h2-v2-migration) into your local file system

### Backup
Before migration - copy and backup the database files somewhere safe:
1. Stop the Rundeck application
1. Copy the H2 database from the Rundeck application directory `{RUNDECK_HOME}/server/data` to the `${backup_directory}` There should be two files
        `grailsdb.mv.db`
        `grailsdb.trace.db`

### Migration to 4.1 from previous versions

#### STEP 1: Generate the new version database

Open a shell terminal and navigate into the `h2-v2-migration` git repo. Execute the `migration.sh` shell command.


    $_>/bin/sh migration.sh -f ${backup_directory}/grailsdb -u ${username} -p ${password} -s v1 -d v2


- The `-f` parameter is required and should be the full path to the backup database file without the extension.
- The optional `-u` parameter is used for database username. If it is not provided, an empty string will be used.
    - If your Rundeck installation is RPM/Deb/War use `sa` for the user name.
    - If your Rundeck installation is from Docker the user name is blank. (leave `-u` out of command)
- The optional `-p` parameter is used for database password. If it is not provided, an empty string will be used.
- The optional `-s` parameter is used to set the source h2 database version. Valid values are `v1` or `v2`. If not
  provided, `v2` will be used.
- The optional `-d` parameter is used to set the destination h2 database version. Valid values are `v2` or `v3`. If not
  provided, `v3` will be used.

By default, the `username` and `password` parameters are both empty string. If you have any custom setup, please use your customized values.

The migration.sh script will create a `output` folder at current location and put all generated files (including the v2 database file) into it.


#### STEP 2: Deploy the new version database
- Use the generated database file `./output/v2/data/grails.mv.db` from the above step to replace your the target Rundeck application database at `{RUNDECK_HOME}/server/data/grails.mv.db`
- Set the permission of the file `{RUNDECK_HOME}/server/data/grails.mv.db` correctly, so Rundeck application can access it with write permission. Login to the docker containerâ€™s shell to change the ownership of the database files by executing the below command:

       sudo chown rundeck:root {RUNDECK_HOME}/server/data/grailsdb.mv.db
- Add the string `;NON_KEYWORDS=MONTH,HOUR,MINUTE,YEAR,SECONDS` to _datasource.url_ in rundeck-config.properties file, i.e., `datasource.url = jdbc:h2:file:[rdbase]/server/data/grailsdb;NON_KEYWORDS=MONTH,HOUR,MINUTE,YEAR,SECONDS;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE`
- Restart the Rundeck application
