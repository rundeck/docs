## Overview

Check out the new features and enhancements for PagerDuty Process Automation, PagerDuty Runbook Automation, and Rundeck Community included in this release. This release includes a new plugin that shows queries status pages from cloud providers and SaaS tools to help users quickly understand if a performance degradation is due to a third party and a number of security and compliance updates and bug fixes.

:::warning
If you are using password authentication with the Rundeck API, the JSESSIONID cookie will change after the first request after authentication. You will have to update your client code to follow redirects for subsequent requests. For example, when using curl you would have to use -b and -c options to update the session cookie in your next request after authentication. Alternately, you could add the -L option to the initial login POST, which will follow the redirect after login and update the session cookie.

### Highlights

**RSS Feed Plugin** - Our new [RSS Feed Plugin](/manual/workflow-steps/rss-feed-plugin.md) helps users quickly understand whether an incident is due to an internal issue or a third-party. The RSS Feed Plugin allows users to query and parse RSS feeds for events from SaaS tools and public cloud providers. For users deploying the [Automated-Diagnostics Solution](/learning/solutions/automated-diagnostics/index.md), this plugin provides a logical first step for implementation.

**Job Resume now works with Parallel/Ruleset strategies** - It's now possible to execute previously failed step(s) with the same inputs on Parallel and Ruleset execution strategies.  When enabled on a Job, the plugin will record the internal Workflow State as the Execution progresses. When one or more steps fail, the Workflow State prior to executing the failed step(s) is recorded and stored and can be restarted if needed.  [Check out all the details here](/manual/execution-lifecycle/job-resume.md).

_Patched CVE-2022-42889_ - A recent security announcement was released for Apache’s common-text library. Rundeck and Process Automation products were not using the library in a vulnerable way, but we still went ahead and made updates to the patched versions to reduce false positives for customers that might be scanning for vulnerabilities.
