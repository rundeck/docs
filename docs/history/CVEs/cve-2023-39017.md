# CVE-2023-39017

## Quartz Scheduler False Positive

[CVE-2023-39017](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39017) might be flagged in Rundeck/Runbook Automation by scanning tools as a vulnerability found in the codebase. 

This CVE is specific to the `quartz-jobs` library, an optional library of pre-built jobs for the Quartz Scheduler, where a wrong usage of
the `org.quartz.jobs.ee.jms.SendQueueMessageJob.execute` method could lead to a code injection vulnerability.

Rundeck/Runbook Automation is not affected as it uses the Quartz Scheduler core library only, and **does not** make use or include the `quartz-jobs` library in its codebase.

This CVE is also disputed. See [https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/issues/943](https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/issues/943).

The team is working on ways to mitigate the false finding and will update this page and Release Notes when we make progress.
