# Version 2.4.0

# Release 2.4.0
=============

Date: 2014-12-16

Name: <span style="color: indigo"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-briefcase"></span> "americano indigo briefcase"</span>

This release has bug fixes and new features, including some GUI improvements.

## New Features

* Job references can override Node Filters. See updates to [XML](/manual/document-format-reference/job-v20.md#jobref) and [YAML](/manual/document-format-reference/job-yaml-v12.md#job-reference-entry) job definition formats as well.
* Job and Option descriptions can contain markdown and HTML. For Jobs, the first line is the short description, and following lines are interpreted as markdown.
* MSSQL compatibility
* Some GUI tweaks and changes
    * A new Action menu is available next to the Job name in job listing and view pages.  Actions include Edit, Duplicate, Delete, and download XML/YAML definitions.
    * The Delete Job link in the Job Edit page has been removed
    * The Job Edit link in job lists has been replaced with an Action menu
    * Hovering on job name in job lists now triggers the detail popup after a slight delay. Previously it was triggered by hovering on the Edit link.
    * Execution follow page layout has been rearranged
    * Added extended Job descriptions (sanitized Markdown/html)
    * Job Edit/Create page: you are now asked to confirm navigation away from the page if you have made changes to the Job

## Incubator features

* Parallel step execution
    - this can be enabled with `rundeck-config.properties` entry:

            feature.incubator.parallelWorkflowStrategy=true

* ssh-agent forwarding for ssh connections
    - this can be enabled per node, project, or server
        framework.properties:

            framework.local-ssh-agent=<true|false>
            framework.local-ttl-ssh-agent=<time in sec>

        project.properties:

            project.local-ssh-agent=<true|false>
            project.local-ttl-ssh-agent=<time in sec>

        Node properties:

            local-ssh-agent=<true|false>
            local-ttl-ssh-agent=<time in sec>

## Compatibility notes


A bug in API v11 XML responses caused them to sometimes be incorrectly wrapped in a `<result>` element, this has now been corrected.  See the [API Docs](/api/rundeck-api.md) for information.  The Rundeck API Java Client library has been updated to workaround this issue (for previous versions of Rundeck).

## What is "americano indigo briefcase"?

New versions of Rundeck will have a name based on the version number. The 2.x theme is Coffee, and 2.4.x is "americano". The point release defines a combination of color and icon we can display in the GUI for easier visual differentiation. 2.4.0 is "indigo briefcase".

> Why yes, I'd like an americano, thank you.
