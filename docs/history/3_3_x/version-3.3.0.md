# Release 3.3.0 - DRAFT

Name: <span style="color: peru"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-flash"></span> "onion ring peru flash"</span>

## Overview

This release includes a long list of useful feature enhancements for our Enterprise and Open Source versions of Rundeck.  **Enhanced Scheduling Options** take job schedules from simple time based runs to comprehensive schedule based executions.  **Guided Tours** are now natively available in the product to guide users through Rundeck processes.  New plugins for managing users, managing nodes, and organizing jobs also streamline administration tasks.  Rundeck 3.3.0 has a whole new engine behind the scenes (Grails 4, Log4J2, Gradle 5, OAuth2, Spring 5, etc.) and now **supports Java 11**.

## Enhancements

### Enhanced Scheduling Options (Enterprise)
#### Schedules
[Schedules](/manual/schedules/project-schedules) can be configured independently from jobs as stand-alone schedules to centralize the management of how often jobs run.

#### Calendars
[Calendars](/manual/calendars) takes the Schedules offering to a level above time based execution to true Schedule based executions.  Define Ad-Hoc Calendars and let Rundeck know when a job is allowed to run or might be blacked out.

### Guided Tour Manager (Enterprise)
A new Rundeck [Guided Tours Manager](/manual/tour-manager) provide an authoring environment to build customizable, interactive walk-throughs to end users to help demonstrate Rundeck processes.  Tours can be used as guidance for first-time users getting familiar with the system, or provide step-by-step instructions for how to execute longer processes.  Tours can now be managed in product with a new UI/Markdown editor to design tour definitions. Guided Tours can be built as System Tours and are available to all projects or Project Tours and tied to that individual project.  As part of this Enterprise update Tours are stored in the Rundeck database so they are easily shared to all members in clustered environments.

### New Log Viewer
A completely re-architected Log Viewer loads job activity faster with improved usability options.  Along with significant performance improvements the new log viewer includes light/dark theme options, and no longer takes over the browser while loading large job output.  There is also the ability to send a URL that link directly to specific lines in the output to streamline collaborative troubleshooting.

### User/Group Management Wizard (Enterprise)
Rundeck user accounts can now be added/managed directly in the Enterprise version of Rundeck. Define local users and groups quickly and easily from the new [User Manager](/manual/user-management/user-mgmt.html#manage-local-users) administration interface.

### Node Wizard Plugin (Enterprise)
New [Node Wizard plugin](/administration/projects/resource-model-sources/node-wizard) is built-in to Rundeck Enterprise for managing node entries local to Rundeck.  The node data is stored in the Rundeck database for easy sharing in clustered environments.  The plugin can still merge values with other Node Sources but offer direct value settings with a friendly GUI based interface.  No need to write complicated JSON/YAML for local Node Sources!

### Job Tags
Use Job Tags to take your Runbook organization to a new level.  Quickly find jobs based on keywords chosen for each job.

### API Enhancements
A new License Status API has been added to allow programmatic checking of your instance license status.

### Extensive Engine Enhancements
Significant updates to the backend offer performance increases and improved security options.  Below are the high level highlights:

- Backend updated to Grails 4 which now support Java 11.
- Spring Security 5 upgrade including [OAuth2 updates](/administration/security/sso). (Be sure to read [docs for changes required when upgrading](/upgrading/upgrading-to-rundeck-3.3.html))
- Logging system upgraded to [Log4J2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) (Be sure to read [docs for changes required when upgrading](/upgrading/upgrading-to-rundeck-3.3.html))

### Docker Updates
- Base image updated to **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**
- **OpenJDK 11** is the installed JVM

From `3.3.0` and on the official Docker images will be based on Ubuntu 18.04 and OpenJDK 11.

With open JDK 11 a new, more flexible max heap setting is available:  
`JVM_MAX_RAM_PERCENTAGE`  

This will set the max heap size to a percentage of the available RAM in the running container.
The default is `75%`.

### Documentation
A significant documentation revamp was done as part of the 3.3.x release.  It can be [found here](https://docs.rundeck.com/) and covers all the new features and functionality.
