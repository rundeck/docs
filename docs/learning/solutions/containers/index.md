# Solution - Containers

## What is PagerDuty's Containers Solution?
Automating container management with Runbook Automation can significantly enhance your business operations by streamlining and simplifying the deployment, scaling, and maintenance of containerized applications. By leveraging Rundeck's powerful automation capabilities, you can reduce manual intervention, minimize human error, and ensure consistent and reliable execution of tasks. This leads to increased efficiency and productivity, as routine and repetitive tasks are handled automatically, freeing up your IT team to focus on more strategic initiatives. 

### Use Cases
There are multiple use-cases and benefits to the Containers solution. Here are a few of the most common examples:

- **Scale Kubernetes Deployoments**: Integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes clusters, enabling DevOps teams to automate complex scaling tasks
- **Diganose issues by checking Pod Status and Errors**: Create jobs to automatically check pod status, retrieve logs, and identify errors at set intervals or in response to specific triggers
- **Gather recent logs from Pods**: Capture state and log information before restarting containers to help troubleshoot after the solution is back online.
- **Start, Kill, and Execute Commands in Containers**: Execute commands in containers to control environment related issues and isolate code execution.

### Prebuilt Automation 
PagerDuty provides a solution that helps users start automating diagnostics quickly. This Solution consists of **prebuilt Automation Jobs** that show how the use cases above can be implemented in your environment.  (Note: Some of these solutions may exist in other Solution Packages.)
