# Capturing Debug Data from Apps in Kubernetes

Similar to how applications are analyzed in non-containerized environments, it is possible to debug and examine the state of programs running inside Kubernetes containers. This is helpful for identifying failure points, memory leaks, and other types of issues.

To accomplish this, the manual process could be messy: launch the pod shell and then execute some debugging commands like `netstat` inside the container.

With the [Kubernetes plugins](/learning/howto/how2kube), commands can be issued directly to a Kubernetes pod, and the output can be captured and persisted in various services like S3, an email, an SFTP server, or an HTTP web service, all of this in a single workflow.

This article demonstrates how to automate this process using Rundeck or Runbook Automation.

## Pre-requisites & Environment Setup

Basic requisites to learn and test this example job:

A Kubernetes cluster like minikube, self-hosted Kubernetes, or a managed Kubernetes - such as AWS EKS.

A valid Kubernetes config stored in your userspace (at `/home/your_user/.kube/config` path, in this article will see how to create this file against an AWS EKS Kubernetes cluster). This is needed by the plugin to dispatch Kubernetes steps against the pods.

Follow the instructions below for a sample setup of this environment

:::tip Skip Ahead
If you already have a Kubernetes cluster to test with, skip to **Step 4** of this section.
:::

This section outlines how to create a sample Kubernetes (EKS) cluster that can be used to test the template Job.  
#### 1. AWS CLI Configuration

   The first tool to configure an EKS cluster is the **aws cli**. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) to install it.

   Now execute:

   `aws configure`

   If working locally, provide an AWS Profile Access Key and Secret Key - otherwise it is recommended to use [IAM Roles](/manual/plugins/aws-plugins-overview.md#option-1-ec2-iam-role).

#### 2. EKSCTL Configuration

EKCTL is the command-line tool to interact with AWS EKS clusters. To download and install follow the steps outlined [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html).

EKS CLI is linked to the AWS CLI configuration. With the AWS CLI configured in the previous step, an EKS cluster can be created with the following command:

```
eksctl create cluster --name test-cluster --version 1.23 --region eu-north-1 --nodegroup-name test-workers --node-type t3.xlarge --nodes 3 --nodes-min 1 --nodes-max 4 --managed
```
#### 3. Create the Kubernetes config

This step allows you to configure the `kubectl` using AWS CLI:

```
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region eu-north-1 --name test-cluster
```

This creates the Kubernetes config file in the `/home/user/.kube/config` file path by default. This file is needed by the Kubernetes plugin configuration.

#### 4. Create a specific namespace

Now let's create a namespace called `auto-diagnostics` for our demo pods.
```
kubectl create namespace auto-diagnostics
```

#### 5. Deploy a simple Tomcat pod

After configuring the entire environment let's deploy a simple Tomcat pod using the `kubectl` tool:

1. Create a YAML file named `tomcat.yaml` with the following content. 
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
    name: tomcat
   spec:
   containers:
   - name: tomcat
     image: tomcat:latest
     ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
   ```
   This file contains the tomcat definition to deploy.<br><br>
2. To deploy the tomcat app execute:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f tomcat.yaml --namespace=auto-diagnostics
   ```
   Now the tomcat pod is running in the cluster.<br><br>
3. To see the running pods in the `auto-diagnostics` cluster namespace:
   ```
   kubectl get pods --namespace=auto-diagnostics
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   NAME 	READY   STATUS	RESTARTS   AGE
   tomcat   1/1 	Running   0      	42s
   ```
   With the Tomcat pod now running, we can retrieve diagnostics using Rundeck or Runbook Automation.

### Plugin installation

:::tip Skip Ahead
You can skip this section if you have using [**Runbook Automation**](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/automation/) version 4.11 (or greater) or [**Runbook Automation**](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/automation/runbook/), 
or if you have already uploaded the latest [Kubernetes plugins](https://github.com/rundeck-plugins/kubernetes).
:::

To install the Kubernetes plugins just check the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [latest plugin release](https://github.com/rundeck-plugins/kubernetes/releases/latest) on Github and download the **`kubernetes-X.X.XX.zip`** file.<br><br>
2. In the Rundeck or Runbook Automation instance, click the **Gear Icon** and then click the **Plugins > Upload Plugin**:
   ![Upload Plugins Menu](/assets/img/upload-plugins-menu.png)
3. Click **Browse** and select the downloaded **`.zip`** file from Step 2.
4. Click **Install**:
   ![Upload Kubernetes Plugins](/assets/img/upload-k8s-plugins.png)

### Running Commands in Pods and Capturing Output

:::tip Skip Ahead
If you are using Runbook Automation, simply look for and select the **Java Thread Dump from Kubernetes Pod** job in the **Automated Diagnostics**
project. If you do _not_ have the **Automated Diagnostics** project, you can download and import it [here](https://github.com/rundeckpro/automated-diagnostics-project/releases/latest). 
<br>Then, skip to **Step 5**.
:::

1. Download the template job by right-clicking and selecting **`Save Link As...`** [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community/main/runbooks/yaml/Solutions/Java_Thread_Dump_Kubernetes_Pod.yaml).
2. Navigate to the **Jobs** tab and click on **Job Actions** -> **Upload Definition**.
3. From the **Choose File** prompt, select the `.yaml` file downloaded in Step 1.
Choose **YAML Format** then click **Upload**.
   :::warning Custom Kubernetes Configuration 
   If the KubeConfig file is not saved in the default location of **`$HOME/.kube/config`** or if using a Kubernetes API Token is preferred, then follow the steps below for [Custom KubeConfig Location or Token Auth](#custom-kubeconfig-location-or-token-auth).
   :::
4. If the steps were followed in the [Pre-requisites & Environment Setup](#pre-requisites-environment-setup) section, type **`auto-diagnostics`** into the **Namespace** field.
5. Type **`tomcat`** into the **Pod Name** field.
6. (Optional) type **`tomcat`** into the **Contaienr Name** field:
![Job Input Parameters](/assets/img/oss-k8s-java-job-invoke-screen.png)
7. Click **Run Job Now**.
   :::tip Note
   By default, the Java thread dump is not printed to the log output. Instead, it is saved as a file and can be 
   configured to be sent to another location inside your network or to a storage-service like **S3** or **Blob Storage**.
   :::
8. Toggle open the specific job steps to view their detailed output:

### Advanced Settings

#### Custom KubeConfig Location or Token Auth

If the KubeConfig file is in a non-standard location, then modify Steps 1 and 2 of the Job to point to the custom kubeconfig location:

1. On the job-run page, click on **Action** -> **Edit this Job...**
2. Click on **Step 1** and in the **Authentication** section, place the kubeconfig file path into the **Kubernetes Config File Path** field. Click **Save** for the specific job step:
   ![Custom KubeConfig](/assets/img/custom-kubeconfig-job-step.png)
3. Repeat the prior step for **Step 2**.

If using an API Token for authentication is preferred over placing the KubeConfig on the Runbook Automation or Rundeck server, then 
place the token into the **API Token** field and also provide the **Cluster URL**.
