# Work With Server Logs

When you debug internal Rundeck activity related to the system, executions, and auditing, it’s important to know where Rundeck stores all internal information.<br>
Logs are text files with all internal behavior printed in. In this article we will demonstrate how to locate different logs depending on the Rundeck installation methods, covering RPM/DEB, WAR-based installation, Apache Tomcat, and Docker container.<br>

## Default Log Location
By default, log files are located at the `/var/log/rundeck` path in the RPM/DEB installations and on WAR-based installations in the `$RDECK_BASE/server/logs` path.<br>

### The `service.log` file

The first place to see anything related to Rundeck is the `service.log` file. This log file stores all the standard input and output generated during runtime, so this is where you will see any problems related to plugins, executions, and Rundeck in general.<br>

#### The `service.log` file is located:

* In the `/var/log/rundeck` path on RPM/DEB installations
* In WAR-based installations, the log file is located at the `$RDECK_BASE/var/log` path (the service needs to be launched using the `$RDECK_BASE/sbin/rundeckd` script, the process is described [here](/administration/maintenance/startup.html#launcher).<br>

For Windows-based instances, the installation process [covers using](/administration/install/windows.html#configuring-rundeck) the standard stdout output to the `service.log` file.<br>

## Service.log content on Docker container and Apache Tomcat

### **Docker Container Installation**

For installations in a Docker container, the service.log content is printed directly in the container log. You can use the `docker logs` command to access that information.<br>
See the current service.log content with:

```
docker logs <container_id>
```

To follow the `service.log` content (equivalent to the command `tail -f /var/log/rundeck/service.log`)

```
docker logs <container_id> –follow
```

![docker-logs](/assets/img/logs_docker.png)

Where `<container_id>` is the Rundeck container ID, you can check with the `docker ps` command, more information [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/).

## Other Rundeck Logs

Rundeck stores all activity information in multiples files, those files are:

`rundeck.access.log` stores all user access to the Rundeck instance.
Entry example:

```

```

`rundeck.api.log` stores all Internal API activity.
Entry example:

```
