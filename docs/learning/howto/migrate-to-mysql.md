# Migrate from Built-in H2 Database to MySQL

Use this guide to migrate a set of Rundeck projects from the built-in H2 database, to use MySQL.  
The instructions assume Rundeck and MySQL are running on Linux/Unix server.

## Project Export All Projects

For each project that needs to be migrated export the archive via the GUI:

1. Open the Project to be archived.
1. Choose **Project Settings > Export Archive**
1. Select appropriate options
1. Click "Export project.rdproject.jar"
1. Wait for export process to complete
1. Click the link to download the file

>Note: make sure to click the final link that is presented to download the file.

Save each project archive file (named "[project name]-XXXX.rdproject.jar")
in a safe place.  They will be needed in a future step.

## Backup Rundeck Data

- Make a backup of the H2 database to use in case of error,
  - RPM/Debian install location: `/var/lib/rundeck/data`
  - Launcher location: `$RDECK_BASE/server/data`

Older versions may also backup file based project definitions.

- Make a backup of all Projects
  - RPM/Debian install location: `/var/rundeck/projects`
  - Launcher location: `$RDECK_BASE/projects`

## Stop Rundeck

Linux/Unix:

    sudo service rundeckd stop

## Setup MySQL

Install MySQL according to the instructions for the destination platform.

## Prepare MySQL database

Perform this command to log in as root:

    mysql -u root -p

Then execute this sql:

    > create database rundeck
    > grant ALL on rundeck.* to 'rundeckuser'@'localhost' identified by 'rundeckpassword'

## Configure rundeck-config.properties

Set the datasource URL to point to the Mysql host, with appropriate database name,
username and password.

See [Configuring Rundeck](/administration/configuration/database/mysql.html#configuring-rundeck) for details.

## Configure Project Config in DB

Enable DB storage for Project configurations, and Key Storage. Optionally enable encryption.

For more info refer to:

- [Security - Key Storage](/manual/key-storage/index.md)
- [Configuring Plugins - Bundled Plugins - Jasypt Encryption Plugin](/administration/configuration/plugins/bundled-plugins.md#jasypt-encryption-plugin)
- [Storage Facility](/administration/configuration/storage-facility.md)

## Start Rundeck

Start the Rundeck server again.

Linux/Unix:

    sudo service rundeckd start

View the "/var/log/rundeck/service.log" file for any error messages.

- Project definitions/configs will be imported to DB automatically
- Resources.xml remain in the same location
