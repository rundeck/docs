# Get the Welcome Project Up and Running

The Rundeck Welcome Projects are sample projects that show how to configure and use Rundeck. In this guide we show you how to set up, start and run the key parts of the Welcome Projects.

There are two Welcome Projects, a Community Welcome Project focused on the Rundeck Open Source and a Welcome Project focused on Process Automation. Once you have the environment set up, you will want to follow the steps in the [Getting Started Tutorial](/learning/tutorial/preparing.md).

### Disclaimer

The Welcome Projects are meant to show users how Rundeck works and are not designed to be used in production. Some of the setup/installation methods used in this environment are not recommended for production deployments. Do not run this environment for production purposes or with sensitive data. For installation best practices follow our documentation ([https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/](/)) site and guidance from our world-class Support team.

## Rundeck Basic Terminology

Before starting, knowing basic Rundeck terminology is useful. All basic concepts are summarized [here](/learning/tutorial/terminology.md).

### Pre-requisites

*   **Docker Desktop** - the open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications on containers, [find information on installing it on your operating system here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

1. Click on the “latest” release in the right,
1. Download the Source Code (.zip) file.
1. Extract the contents to a folder on your local hard drive.

@tab Enterprise Welcome Project

## Building the Environment

Use your terminal program and navigate to the directory where the Source Code was extracted.

From the command line, build the docker base images.

```
docker-compose build
```

The initial build can take a few minutes.

**NOTE:** Building is not mandatory the first time. Use 'build' to update the images used to the latest version.

## Starting the Environment

Start the environment with the following command. Running this command starts all the container components in the background and leaves them running.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This process can take some time.  To check if Rundeck is ready to use, follow the logs using the commands in the next section.

## Monitoring Rundeck

If you want to see Rundeck logs in real-time, open a new terminal window and execute the following command:

```
docker logs -f rundeck
```

> Alternatively leave off the `-d` from the `docker-compose up` command above and all the logs will be printed on screen.

## Familiarize Yourself with Rundeck!

Once your environment is fully operational, [start the Tutorial here](/learning/tutorial/preparing.md).

## Stop the Environment

Use the following command to stop the system, but keep the work you've done so far:

```
docker-compose stop
```

To remove the containers that were built and free up space on your machine:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Cleaning up the Environment

This command will remove all associated volumes and images as well.

```
docker-compose down --volume --rmi all
