# Getting Started with Terraform and Rundeck

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON.

[The Rundeck Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/rundeck/rundeck/latest/docs) allows Terraform to create and configure Projects, Jobs and Keys in Rundeck. The project resource allows Rundeck projects to be managed by Terraform. In Rundeck a project is the container object for a set of jobs and the configuration for which servers those jobs can be run on.

## Pre-Requisites

- This Exercise is build based on the Welcome Projects.  Please ensure you have completed the tutorial and have that environment running.
- [Terraform must be installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) on your local machine. Confirm with `terraform -version`.  Latest version as of writing is _1.0.3_.
- General understanding of using your computers terminal program.

## Exercise

::: tabs
@tab Create an API Key

1. Login as `admin` to your Welcome Project (same steps Community or Enterprise)
1. In the upper right corner click the person icon and choose Profile
    ![User > Profile](/assets/img/howto-user-profile.png)
1. Click the plus (**+**) next to **User API Tokens**
1. Name the token `terraform`
1. User can remain `admin`
1. Rest of the fields can be blank/defaults.
1. Click **Generate New Token**

A box will pop up.  Be sure to copy the API Token somewhere before clicking **Close**.  The API token will be used in the next Exercise.

@tab Terraform Exercise 1

1. Create a working directory on your machine for this exercise.
1. Copy the contents from the **Terraform Plan File** (tabs below) to a file called `rundeck-build.tf` in your working directory.
2. Ensure the value for `url` is accurate for your Rundeck instance. (The default will work with the Welcome Projects)
3. Replace the `your-auth-token` value on line 13 with the value from the Create API Key steps.
4. Copy the contents from the **ACL Example File** (tabs below) to a file called `acl.yaml` in your working directory.
5. In your computer's terminal program navigate to your working directory.
6. Execute the command `terraform init`
7. Execute the command `terraform apply`
8. Type `yes` to confirm the changes

The following items will have been added to your Welcome Project
- A new Project called "Terraform Example"
- Two entries in the Key Storage under the "terraform" folder
- A new ACL Entry that would allow any one in the "terraform" group full access to this project and read access to others.  (Note: The group is not created, but for extra credit give it a try!)

@tab Terraform Exercise 2
> This requires a success with Exercise 1

To see the power of managing Rundeck Projects with Terraform we can make some minor adjustments to the Plan File and apply those changes.

1. On line 31 of the _rundeck-build.tf_ file change the `"project.label" = "Terraform Example"` to `"project.label" = "My Terraform Example"`
1. Execute the command `terraform apply`
1. Type `yes` to confirm the changes

The project will be updated with a new Label value.  To confirm click the Rundeck logo in the upper left of the interface to load the project list.
