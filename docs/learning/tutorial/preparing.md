# 0. Getting Started - Tutorial Preparations

The _Tutorial_ section is built around our Welcome Projects. The Rundeck Welcome Projects are sample projects that show how to configure and use Rundeck.

Both Rundeck product versions, Enterprise and Community, have a companion set of code at the following links. These code bases allow running Rundeck in a Docker environment with the Welcome Project preloaded.

- Enterprise: [https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project](https://github.com/rundeckpro/welcome-project)
- Community: [https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community](https://github.com/rundeck/welcome-project-community)

Use the [Welcome Projects Starter How To article](/learning/howto/welcome-project-starter.md) to learn how to get started with these environments.

:::tip
Note: The Enterprise version will require a license file. If you aren’t currently an Enterprise customer and you’re interested in using that please [contact us here](https://www.rundeck.com/see-demo).

:::warning
It is possible to run the Welcome Projects in other environments, but some exercise steps will need to be adjusted for your specific environment

It will be helpful to review our [Terminology Tutorial](/learning/tutorial/terminology.md) prior to starting.
