:::

Adding User accounts to Rundeck can be done in many ways. Process Automation supports [Single Sign-On solutions](/administration/security/sso.md), [LDAP Authentication](/administration/security/authentication.html#ldap) and a variety of other options.

The User Summary tab shows a list of users configured on the Rundeck system.

`admin` This is the default administration account included with all Rundeck installations.
`alice` and `betty` (and some of their friends) are configured by default with more restrictive rights. (the default password for all accounts is admin)

Follow the Exercise below to add your own user:
