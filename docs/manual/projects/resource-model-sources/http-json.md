# HTTP-JSON Node Source

:::enterprise
:::

The HTTP-JSON Node Source will gather Node definitions from an HTTP endpoint.

### Features
* Ability to specify authentication credentials to the endpoint.
* Ability to specify custom headers on the request to the endpoint.
* Ability to transform the JSON payload returned by the endpoint with a JQ expression.
* Ability to add supplemental tags to all the nodes returned by the endpoint.

### Requirements
* The configured endpoint must return a JSON payload.  
* The JSON should conform to the [JSON](/manual/document-format-reference/resource-json-v10.html) Rundeck nodes format.  There is an option to transform other sources using a JQ Transform

## Configuration

1. Specify the **URL** endpoint to hit.
1. (Optional) **Authorization Header** If your endpoint requires authentication, either manually type in the value or select a Key Storage path that will be used for the `Authorization` header. Note: If your token needs a 'Bearer' prefix, you must add it manually.`
1. (Optional) **Supplemental Headers** If your URL requires custom headers, add them here.
> Note: If you manually add a `Content-Type` header it will be overridden by the plugin because the plugin requires an `application/json` response.
1. (Optional) **JQ Transform** If your JSON payload needs to be transformed, add a JQ expression here. The transformed JSON should conform to the [JSON](/manual/document-format-reference/resource-json-v10.html) Nodes format. If you don't supply a JQ expression, the plugin will assume the JSON payload retrieved from the URL conforms to the proper format.
1. (Optional) **Supplemental Tags** If you want to add tags to all the nodes returned by the endpoint, add them here as a comma separated list.
