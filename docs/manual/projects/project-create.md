# Project Create

A project can be created either from the graphical console or using the [rd] shell tool.

## Graphical Interface

In the graphical console, you will notice a Project Picker in the top navigation bar.  This is the primary access to the different projects.  To see the full Project Menu click on _View All Projects_ or click the Rundeck logo in the upper left of the screen.

_Details_

Name

: This is the unique identifier for the project. Project names can contain letters and numbers but do not use spaces or special characters.

Label

: You may wish to use a more user friendly display name for the project. The project label can contain spaces and other characters.

Description

: A brief explanation about the project. Normally, this is just one phrase or sentence explaining the project purpose. If you have large amounts of text, consider creating a project README.


_Execution History Clean_

When you enable Execution History Clean, you can control the frequency
which Rundeck removes your execution history.

_Execution Mode_

Disable Execution

: Turn off the ability to execute jobs and ad-hoc commands.

Disable Schedule

: Turn off the job scheduling feature.

_User Interface_

Job Group Expansion Level

: In the Jobs page, how should the job groups be collapsed? A `1` is default and shows one group level opened. Use `0` to collapse all. Use `-1` to expand all.

Display the Readme

: Show the Readme in the project list and/or home page.

Display the MOTD

: Show the Readme in the project list and/or home page.

_Default Node Executor_

The Node Executor is responsible for executing commands and scripts on remote nodes. On Linux machines, SSH will be default.

_Default File Copier_

The File Copier is responsible for copying scripts as files to remote nodes before they are executed. On Linux machines, SCP will be default.

_Create_

After filling in the project create form, Rundeck initializes it and returns
you to the default page (eg, "Jobs").

Projects can be created at any time by going back to the Project menu
and clicking on the "New Project" link in the navigation menu or by going to the home page and pressing the "New Project" button.

The project setup process generates Project configuration in the server, and
a local resource model containing information about the rundeck server node.

## Automating

### CLI Usage

The [rd projects][rd] command can be used to script the creation for projects. See the `rd projects create help` output for syntax usage.

Execute the `rd projects create` command and
specify a project name, here we use "MyProject":

```bash
rd projects create -p MyProject
```

You can also declare configuration properties when you create the project.

Here a project label and the default SSH key properties are declared as command line options:

```bash
rd projects create -p MyProject -- \
   --project.label="My Project" \
   --project.ssh-keypath=/home/rundeck/.ssh/id_rsa
```

You can specify a resource model source by specifying keys as command line options, too.
Here a Directory model source is also defined.

```bash
rd projects create -p MyProject -- \
  --project.label="My Project" \
  --project.ssh-keypath=/home/rundeck/.ssh/id_rsa \
  --resources.source.2.type=directory \
  --resources.source.2.config.directory=/home/rundeck/projects/MyProject/resources.d
```
