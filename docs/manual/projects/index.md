# Projects

A _project_ is a place to separate management activity.
All Rundeck activities occur within the context of a project.
Multiple projects can be maintained on the same Rundeck server.
Projects are independent from one another, so you can use them to
organize unrelated systems within a single Rundeck
installation. This can be useful for managing different teams, infrastructures,
environments or applications.

Projects can be [archived](/manual/projects/project-archive.md) and imported to other Rundeck servers to help
promote changes between environments.

A new installation will not contain any projects so Rundeck will present
you with a dialog to create one.
