**AI-Generated Runbooks** provides an AI-enhanced approach to creating new automation Jobs.  Through natural-language prompts, users can generate the baseline starting-point for the Job definition.

The AI-Generated Runbooks feature helps new users get started with Runbook Automation. Through example prompts, new users quickly learn the types of use-cases that Runbook Automation is suited to address.

AI-Generated Runbooks also helps experienced authors of Jobs by reducing the time spent creating the Job definition and searching through third-party technical documentation.

### Job Review Best Practices
Since the content of the Job is generated using a large-language model, it is best-practice to review the generated content for accuracy.  Once reviewed and adjusted, it is also
best-practice to test the Job in a non-production environment.  These best practices are presented to the user when the Job is created using _AI-Generated Runbooks_:

## AI Model and Security
_AI-Generated Runbooks_ is powered by a combination of a large-language generative AI model and [prompt-engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering).

Through this configuration, **the only data sent to the generative AI model is the text entered into the prompt field.**  No other data about your environment, 
existing Jobs or the source of the prompt is sent to the AI model.  Furthermore, **the AI model is not trained on the text entered into the prompt.**

For further questions about the AI Model and security, please [contact support](/about/getting-help.html). 

[comment]: <> (Current limitations)
## Current Limitations

The current _AI-Generated Runbooks_ feature is trained to generate a full, multi-step Job - including Job Options and Secret Job Options.

However, the generated content does not yet produce:

1. Node Filter
2. Runner configuration
3. Log Filters (and passing data between steps)
4. Schedules
5. Notification Plugins
6. ROI Metric configuration

These features will be produced by _AI-Generated Runbooks_ in future releases.
