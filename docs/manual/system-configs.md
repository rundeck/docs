## Key Storage

The Key Storage facility provides GUI backed by an [API](/api/index.md#key-storage) to manage public, private keys and passwords.
These stored keys are used by many different types of Rundeck plugins.  The Key Storage entries can also be used in Job definitions as secure value inputs.

Keys can be stored either using an uploaded file or as text input.

### Key store organization

Key Storage organizes keys similar to how files are organized in a file system. Keys can be organized into a folder structure.
Here's an example convention that uses three fields to manage keys.

    keys/projects/{project}/nodes/{node}/{identity}.pem convention

The fields in the pattern provide slots to allow multiple projects and users.

- project: project name
- node: might be a specific node or could be a class name like 'www'.
- identity: the name of the user.

### Add Private Key with text

The Key Store page provides a simple browser to navigate the folders and perform actions on the keys.

Press the "Add or Upload a Key" button.

Next, choose "Private Key" for the Key type.

Key data can be added using the content of an uploaded file or as text input.

Choose the "Enter text" option. Paste the key content here.

Enter the storage path and give the key a name.

Here's the form with all the input.

Press the "Save" button.
