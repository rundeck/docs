# Plugins

## Overview

Process Automation is a sophisticated orchestration platform with numerous types of integrations called _plugins_. 

The functionality of plugins ranges from executing commands on nodes, performing steps in a workflow, sending notifications about job status, gathering information about the hosts on a network, copying a file to a remote server, storing and streaming logs, and much more.

This section is a guide for the basic configuration of plugins. For a detailed list of the various types of plugins, click [here](/administration/configuration/plugins/plugin-types.html#types-of-plugins).

For administrators and advanced-users, here is additional documentation on Installing Plugins and [advanced configuration settings](/administration/configuration/plugins/configuring).

For developers interested in developing new plugins or contributing to open-source plugins, click [here](/developer/01-plugin-development).

## Plugins Configuration

All plugins are configured by defining plugin properties - such as credentials and endpoints.  These properties can be defined on a per-plugin, project, or system basis.

Plugin properties are prioritized for usage in the following order:
1. **Individual Plugin**
2. **Project**
3. **System**

For example, if credentials for integrating with Jira are defined both in the _**Project**_ configuration _and_ in a specific Jira Job Step plugin, then the credentials defined in the Job Step will be used.

A plugin _suite_ is a group of plugins that share a set of the same properties.  Most often, this is a group of plugins that are built to integrate with the same third-party product - such as the [PagerDuty Plugins](/manual/workflow-steps/pagerduty).

### Project Level Plugin Configuration

To configure a plugin-suite for a project, navigate to **Project Settings** -> **Edit Configuration** -> **Plugins**:

:::warning Enable Beta Feature
Configuring plugins at the project level using the following user-interface is in beta. For plugin suites that have not yet been added to this feature, use the [Graphical Interface for Project Configuration](/manual/projects/configuration).<br><br>
To enable this feature, add **`rundeck.feature.pluginGroups.enabled=true`** to the `framework.properties` file,
or add the following **_Custom Config_** to [Configuration Management](/manual/configuration-mgmt/configmgmt):<br>
**Property Name** = **`rundeck.feature.pluginGroups.enabled`**<br>
**Property Value** = **`true`**

Click on **PluginGroup+** and select the desired Plugin Suite from the list.

The properties for the chosen plugin-suite will now be available to configure.  Once the properties are filled in, click **Save** for that plugin-suite.  Then click **Save** at the bottom of the page:

![Saving pluing suite settings](/assets/img/saving-plugin-suite-settings.png)<br>

When the configuration is saved, all plugins for the given suite in that project will default to these properties. 

### System Level Plugin Configuration

To configure a plugin-suite for the system - thereby spanning all projects - click on the **Gear Icon** (upper right) -> **System Configuration**.

Navigate to the plugin-suite name - such as PagerDuty - and click the **Pencil Icon** in the upper right:

![Edit Plugin Suite Sysytem Level](/assets/img/edit-plugin-suite-system-level.png)<br>

Place the properties into their associated fields and then click **Save**.  

When the configuration is saved, all plugins for the specified suite across all projects will default to the defined properties.
