## What is this guide about?

Welcome to the Rundeck user guide. This guide was written to help
you quickly become productive with the Rundeck server and tools. 

## What is Rundeck?

Rundeck is an operations management platform that helps you connect your people with the processes and tools they need to get their job done. Rundeck will help alleviate the time-consuming grunt work and toil that currently consumes too much of your team's time. With Rundeck you will get more done, respond quicker to incidents, and spend less time in ticket queues.

The most common usage of Rundeck is to create standard operating procedures from any of your existing tools or scripts. Trigger Rundeck jobs from the Web GUI, API, CLI, or by schedule. Rundeck's access control features make it easy to safely delegate control of tasks to those traditionally outside of operations.  

Rundeck was designed to accept the reality that heterogeneous infrastructure and tooling are a fact of life in any sizable organization. That is why Rundeck doesn't make you replace the scripts, commands, or tools you use today. You use Rundeck to execute workflows across your existing automation (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, legacy tools, and all of your custom scripts/APIs) or quickly automate previously manual procedures. With Rundeck you can reuse the automation skills you already have and add new ones as needed.

Out of the box, Rundeck gives you capabilities that would be expensive to develop and maintain in-house: workflow control,  scheduling, error-handling, logging, access control, option passing, log filtering, web GUI, REST API (with CLI tools)  and integration with external sources for authentication, resource model, and option data.

## Is Rundeck free?
#### Rundeck
At its core, Rundeck is free open source software licensed under the [Apache Software License] (v2.0), and you can participate in the project on [GitHub].  For those who write and run Rundeck jobs at small-scale usage (e.g., limited use or within a team), the open-source Rundeck delivers you the features you need, for free, forever. 

#### Rundeck Pro
The focus of [Rundeck Pro], our commercial offering, is on making Rundeck production-ready and enterprise-scale.  Rundeck Pro, built on the open source Rundeck, is the bundle of software and services you need to run Rundeck as an enterprise-class service. 

Built and tested for the enterprise, Rundeck Pro includes exclusive features (including clustering/HA, advanced workflow, enhanced ACL management, enhanced dashboards/visualization) and Rundeck Pro exclusive plugins. Professional support and on-boarding services are also part of the Rundeck Pro subscription bundle.
