Note: these instructions are for installing a single instance "cluster" (one cluster member only) for evaluation or standalone usage. 

## Install Rundeck Pro

This guide will install Rundeck PRO as a Service on a Windows Server. It uses the Rundeck Pro launcher installer (Jar file).
 
* Download the latest version of Rundeck PRO Cluster launcher here:  http://download.rundeck.com/versions.html
* Choose a root directory (e.g. C:\rundeck). 
* Place rundeckpro-launcher-cluster-X.X.X.jar in that directory
* Go to the RDECK_BASE (e.g. C:\rundeck) folder and launch the installation of rundeck.

```
cd C:\rundeck
java -jar rundeckpro-launcher-cluster-X.X.X.jar
```

* After Rundeck PRO started, stop the process.
* Create a bat file (e.g. start_rundeck.bat) and place it under %RDECK_BASE%

```
set CURDIR=%~dp0
call %CURDIR%etc\profile.bat
java %RDECK_CLI_OPTS% %RDECK_SSL_OPTS% -jar    
rundeckpro-launcher-cluster-X.X.X.jar --skipinstall -d  >> %CURDIR%\var\logs\service.log  2>&1
```

* Download nssm.exe from http://nssm.cc/
* Place the executable under %RDECK_BASE% (you can place it elsewhere, but for the sake of the example let's use always the root dir)
* Open a prompt and issue these commands (Administrator mode required to install a service)

```
    cd C:\rundeck
    nssm.exe install RUNDECK
```
* the GUI pops up, set "path" as %RDECK_BASE%\start_rundeck.bat , startup directory  as %RDECK_BASE% (optionally set "low" on the process tab, under priority, to avoid server cpu spike when starting rundeck)

![NSSM Installer](../../figures/nssm-installer.png)

* Go to the service management console (services.msc) and you'll find RUNDECK listed as a service. Starting it will start the rundeck process.

### Encrypted key/config storage 

Encrypted key/config storage enabled by default. The default encryption algorithm is stronger than the “Default JCE Policy” used in earlier versions of Java 1.8

Note: If you receive an error message about encryption policy strength with creating projects or keys you will need to upgrade your Java 1.8 version, or set the encryption algorithm in `rundeck-config.properties` to a lower strength algorithm such as `PBEWithMD5AndDES`

Further information about encrypted key/config storage on [this](http://rundeck.org/docs/plugins-user-guide/bundled-plugins.html#jasypt-encryption-plugin) link.


### Login to the GUI
 
By default, Rundeck will be installed in port 4440. To access Rundeck, go to the following URL: http://servername:4440.
 
Normally, it is necessary to modify the `grails.serverURL` property in `%RDECK_BASE%\server\config\rundeck-config.properties` to access the GUI.
Change `grails.serverURL` to the server name or IP. You will need to restart
the Rundeck service for the change to take effect.

After the restart, you can access the GUI at http://servername:4440/

The default username and password is "admin"

### Start-Stop instances

Use the Service Windows GUI to start/stop/restart the instance

## Enable CREPSSP Authentication On Windows Domain

### On the Rundeck server

#### Enable CredSSP

Open a powershell windows and run:

```
Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role "Client" -DelegateComputer "*.something.com"
```

Where `something.com` is the DNS domain of the target computer

or

```
Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role "Client" -DelegateComputer "*"
```


#### Allow Delegating Fresh Credentials

* Click **Start**, type **mmc** and then click **OK**.
* Click **File and then click **Add/Remove Snap-in**.
* Click **Group Policy Object** and then click **Add**.
* Select **Local Computer** and then click **Finish**.
* Go to **Computer Policy\Administrative Templates\System\Credentials Delegation\Allow Delegating Fresh Credentials** → Set to **enabled** 

![Enable delegating fresh credentials](../../figures/allow-delegating-fresh-credentials-1.png)

* Add **WSMAN/*** to list of computers and check the box for **Concatenate OS defaults with input above**.

![Add servers to list](../../figures/allow-delegating-fresh-credentials-2.png)

#### Enable CredSSP authentication on Winrm Client

Open a CMD Prompt as an Administrator user and execute:

```
winrm set winrm/config/client/auth @{CredSSP="true"}
```

You need to have winrm service configured and running.


### On the remote node

#### Enable CredSSP

Open a powershell windows and run:

```
Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role "Server"
```

#### Make sure that you enable the CredSSP on WinRM Service settings

To get the WinRm Service config:

```
winrm get winrm/config/service
```

To enable the CredSSP:

```
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{CredSSP="true"}
```

### Troubleshooting

If you are using a non-administrator user (or a not- domain-administrator user) to execute command to remote nodes, you need to set up the access on the remote machine ( to the user or some of its groups, eg: Domain User group).

To add permissions to non-administrator user to execute remote commands:

```
Set-PSSessionConfiguration Microsoft.Powershell -ShowSecurityDescriptorUI
```
