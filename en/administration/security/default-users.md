## Logins 

Rundeck supports a number of user directory configurations. By
default, the installation uses a file based directory, but connectivity to
LDAP is also available. 
See [Authentication][page:administration/security/authentication.md].

The Rundeck installation process will have defined a set of temporary
logins useful during the getting started phase.

* `user`: Has access to run commands and jobs but unable to modify job
  definitions. Password: "user"
* `admin`: Belongs to the "admin" group and is automatically granted
  the "admin" and "user" role privileges. Password: "admin"
  
## Group membership

If you installed Rundeck using the RPM installation method, it will
have created a unix group called "rundeck".
