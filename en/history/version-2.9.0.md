This release contains a number of enhancements:

For more detail see [2.9.0 Changes](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/issues/2577)

1. Data Capture/Data Passing between steps 
	* Data capture plugin to match a regular expression in a step's log output and pass the values to later steps
2. Log Filter Plugins
	* These plugins can be applied to individual steps, or to the entire workflow
	* Data type plugins can detect or mark formatted data such as JSON, CSV, HTML, Markdown, etc. and render it in the GUI
	* Mask Passwords plugin removes any values from secure input options before it is logged
	* Highlighting/quelling: highlight keywords or selectively quell output from verbose scripts
	* (And of course, you can write your own plugins...)
2. New Job and Project features: 
	* Export a project to another Rundeck instance
	* Copy a Job to another Project
	* Reference a Job in another Project
	* Check state of a job in another project
	* Disable Job Schedules or all Executions for a project
	* Improved Time Zone support
	* Allow matching 0 nodes as success condition
	* Retry delay
4. GUI changes
	* Rearranged the Project and System configuration pages and navigation
	* Job workflow editor enhancements

Stay tuned! We are also adding many new features to [Rundeck Pro](http://rundeck.com).
